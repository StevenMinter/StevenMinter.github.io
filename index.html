                My name is <b>Steven Minter</b> and I was born on October 8th, 1998. I recently turned 21 and am a Junior majoring in Sport Management. I have passions that include baseball, snowboarding, and visiting the beach. It is a bonus if I can enjoy these activities with family and friends. 
            </p> 
            <p>Speaking of family, I will be an uncle in April. My brother and sister in law had a spooky gender reveal in October and the baby is a girl. I cannot wait to meet my new niece. They are naming her "Charlotte" and will call her Charlie for short. 
            </p>
            <p> I played baseball for 17 years and it has always been my passion. I recently picked up snowboarding last winter but when I say that it was the best trip, I'm not exaggerating. We went to <a href="http://www.skisugar.com">Sugar Mountain</a>
                in North Carolina and the thrill of snowboarding is like no other. I look forward to going again this year. It's always nice going in the winter and having something to look forward to in the summer like going to the beach. I can't think of many places I would rather be than at the beach fishing. I love being outdoors.
